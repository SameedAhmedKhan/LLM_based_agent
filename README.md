# LLM Based Agent

The program makes use of LLM based Intelligent Agent to execute commands in order to achieve a target.

For example, in order to create an order, the agent goes through the script and sends a post request needs with required information to create an order.
For now, only 3 actions are possible through this agent:
1. Create Order
2. ⁠Create Customer
3. ⁠Find Item Catalog
Through the same idea, it’s possible to extend the program to handle more functions. 

The program is still incomplete and can be improved. Due to numerous reasons, including limited time spent on the project, very limited resources etc we haven’t been able to complete the program.
